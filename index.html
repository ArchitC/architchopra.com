            <h1>Hi, I'm Archit Chopra, and I study computer science at Northwestern.</h1>
            <div class="me">
                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm passionate about projects that help move society to a more
                sustainable future, whether that relates to overcoming socioeconomic
                barriers or promoting equity. I'm most interested in working on
                consumer-facing ideas that involve thoughtful design. Currently, I'm
                looking for opportunities in software, product, and venture.</p>
                <p>Outside of those interests, I spend my time trying out new things
                (traveling + exercise), creating interesting designs, and building
                relationships.</p>

                <h2>Current Work</h2>
                <p>This upcoming summer, I'll be working with American Express on
                their AI/ML teams. At Northwestern, I work with <a href="https://thegarage.northwestern.edu/">
                The Garage</a> to help organize their annual trip to Silicon Valley. Additionally,
                here are some projects I'm working on right now:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Saguaro, a community of like-minded undergraduate students with technical
                    experience who come together to solve problems that they are passionate about</li>
                    <li>HackNU, the first and only university level hackathon that operates at
                    Northwestern</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you wanna chat about any of these ideas, feel free to
                <a href="mailto:ArchitChopra2022@u.northwestern.edu">email</a> me or message me on
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/archit-chopra-643886152/">LinkedIn</a>. Head over
                to the 'work' page to learn more about any of these.</p>
