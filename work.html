                        <h2>Saguaro</h2>
                        <p>Saguaro is a software oriented startup I created
                        with some friends based on principles of social impact
                        and thoughtful design. Since inception in Februaru 2020,
                        we have joined The Garage at Northwestern and have begun
                        the ideation stage.</p>
                        <p>The current emphasis of Saguaro's efforts is on developing
                        community based socialization platforms that help combat
                        the feeling of isolation that millenials face. We believe this
                        is an especially relevant focus with the coming rise in automation
                        and introduction of work from home technologies. </p>

                        <p>HackNU is Northwestern's only hackathon that engages with the
                        entire student body. Co-founded by me and one other CS major,
                        HackNU is currently reaching out to coroporations for potential
                        sponsorship and judging with the expected launch in Fall 2020.</p>
                        <p>Looking around at peer institutions, I noticed that there were
                        limited opportunities for Northwestern engineering students to get
                        involved with the problem-solving mindset and expand their learning
                        beyond the classroom. </p>

                        <p>Paxelisk was a social media brand I created at the end of
                        middle school. It started out as a single account on a niche
                        platform called iFunny that spread to other services like
                        Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr. After reaching a combined 300K
                        followers, I started to pursue monetization strategies in the form
                        of click-based sponsorships with clothing companies.</p>
                        <p>Outside of the social media brand, I took lessons at a local
                        makerspace to learn how to create wooden accessories that would
                        capitalize on relevant internet trends. For example, selling little
                        frog men that resembled Kermit.</p>
